        <strong>{{ site.title }}</strong> is a shell script to grab ⏬ your files from a remote FTP server to your NAS / server / computer.<br />
        A hash is created for each downloaded file and will prevent to download it again even if it is not present in the destination folder.<br />
        You can also apply a filter to search for files with a regular expression.
      </p>
      <p class="markdown-body">
        Because this script only needs <code>wget</code>, it is ideal for those with a seedbox to grab your files to your NAS (Synology Qnap D-Link).<br />
        With the sqlite3 HASH_STORAGE method, the performance will be improved 🔥 !
      </p>
      <p class="markdown-body">
        It is free and open source and always will be 🔓 !<br />
        To be notified of new releases you can star 🌟 the <a href="{{ var_repo_url }}">project on Github</a>.
